\subsection{Seminar Structure}
\label{sec:Structure}

\TD{A convincing plan for the structure of the seminar should be provided. 
We do not expect a detailed hourly plan. But information like whether there 
would be talks, discussion and breakout sessions, demos, plenary session, 
etc. would help reviewers judge whether the composition of the planned 
seminar is likely to be successful.

Particularly for short seminars (3 days), it would be of the essence that 
the seminar is prepared and organized in a very disciplined manner in order 
to achieve a tangible outcome.}
