\TD{Timeliness and relevance of the proposed topic are important factors in 
the evaluation. Organizers are, therefore, advised to demonstrate them in 
the proposal text.
Seminars are limited to topics that substantially involve computer 
science research. There are no further restrictions.
Interdisciplinary topics, be it in computer science and its peripheral 
areas or with completely different topics (biology, chemistry, medicine, 
physics, psychology, law, history, etc.) as well as topics with industrial 
or industry-related applications are especially welcome.
