\label{sec:Outcome}

\TD{Reviewers often wonder what the outcome of a proposed seminar would be. 
It is in the nature of seminars that it is difficult to predict the outcome. 
However, it does help to know what you envisage as the possible outcomes. 
Keep in mind that in planning those outcomes, substantial involvement of the 
invitees beyond the seminar may be unrealistic.}
